Hi there, welcome to database-sales repository

This repository is about retrievement of information from a sales database using SQL.
The objectives of the contents in this repo are to propose
(1) query that displays all collumns in a table using two different ways,
(2) query to return "deal_penjualan" which lesser than "rerata_penjualan_tiap_daerah" using correlated subqueries, and
(3) query to find salespersons who are not in "Jakarta Barat" using CASE statement.
I hope this repository can be useful

OK thanks! See you later
